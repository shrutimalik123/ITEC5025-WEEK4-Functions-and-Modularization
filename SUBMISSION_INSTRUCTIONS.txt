## How to Create Submission Package

### Option 1: Using File Explorer (Windows)
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `c:\Users\Owner\Documents\ITEC5025-WEEK4-Functions-and-Modularization`
3. Select the following files:
   - main.py
   - translation_module.py
   - medical_terms.py
   - utils.py
   - test_translations.py
   - README.md
4. Right-click → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder
5. Name it: `ITEC5025-Week4-YourName.zip`

### Option 2: Using PowerShell
Run this command from the project directory:
```powershell
Compress-Archive -Path main.py,translation_module.py,medical_terms.py,utils.py,test_translations.py,README.md -DestinationPath ITEC5025-Week4-Submission.zip
```

## How to Test Before Submission

1. **Run the test suite**:
   ```
   py test_translations.py
   ```
   Expected: All tests pass ✓

2. **Run the interactive chatbot**:
   ```
   py main.py
   ```
   Expected: Chatbot starts and accepts commands

3. **Test sample interactions**:
   - `translate "hello" to spanish` → Should return "hola"
   - `medical "headache" to spanish` → Should return "dolor de cabeza"
   - `help` → Should display help menu
   - `quit` → Should exit gracefully
